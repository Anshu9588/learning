# - **Modern APIs**

- Modules (`import`/`export`), ES modules vs. CommonJS
- Dynamic imports and code splitting

Good morning\! Let's get started on a very important topic for modern web development: JavaScript modules and code splitting.

### \#\# Part 1: High-Importance Questions 🌟

---

#### **1. What are ES modules? How do `import` and `export` work?**

ES modules (ESM) are the official, standardized module system in JavaScript. They allow you to break up your code into reusable, self-contained files (modules) and share functionality between them.

- **`export`**: This keyword is used to make variables, functions, or classes available to other modules. You can have multiple **named exports** from a single module and at most one **default export**.

- **`import`**: This keyword is used to bring exported functionality from another module into the current module's scope. You can import named exports specifically by name, or import the default export.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// 📁 utils.js
// Named export
export const PI = 3.14159;
// Named export
export function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
// Default export
export default function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}

// 📁 main.js
// Importing named exports by name
import { PI, add } from "./utils.js";
// Importing the default export (can be named anything)
import multiplyNumbers from "./utils.js";

console.log(PI); // 3.14159
console.log(add(2, 3)); // 5
console.log(multiplyNumbers(2, 3)); // 6
```

#### **2. Compare ES modules (import/export) with CommonJS (require/module.exports). What are the key differences?**

ES modules and CommonJS are the two primary module systems in the JavaScript ecosystem, but they have fundamental differences:

| Feature          | ES Modules (ESM)                                                                                                                                                | CommonJS (CJS)                                                                                                                      |
| :--------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Syntax**       | Uses `import` and `export` keywords.                                                                                                                            | Uses `require()` function and `module.exports` object.                                                                              |
| **Loading**      | **Asynchronous** (top-level `await` is supported). The engine can load modules in parallel.                                                                     | **Synchronous**. `require()` is a blocking call that reads the file, compiles, and executes it.                                     |
| **Parsing**      | **Static**. The module structure is determined at compile time. You can't use variables in `import` statements.                                                 | **Dynamic**. `require()` is just a function call. You can use variables and logic to decide what to load.                           |
| **Tree Shaking** | **Supported**. Because the structure is static, bundlers can analyze which exports are used and remove the unused ones.                                         | **Not well supported**. The dynamic nature makes it hard for bundlers to determine what is used at compile time.                    |
| **Environment**  | The standard for browsers and modern Node.js.                                                                                                                   | The traditional standard for Node.js.                                                                                               |
| **Bindings**     | Exports are **live, read-only views** of the variables. If the variable's value changes in the original module, the change is reflected in the imported module. | Exports are **copies of the values**. Primitives are copied, and objects are copied by reference. The imported value is a snapshot. |

#### **3. How does module resolution work in Node.js for ES modules vs. CommonJS?**

Module resolution is the process of finding the absolute path to a module file.

- **CommonJS**: Uses a simple, synchronous algorithm. When you `require('module-name')`:

  1.  If `module-name` is a core module (like `fs`), it returns that.
  2.  If it starts with `./` or `../`, it's treated as a relative path. Node looks for `.js`, `.json`, or `.node` files.
  3.  If it's a bare specifier (like `express`), Node looks for it in the `node_modules` directory, walking up from the current directory to the root.

- **ES Modules**: The resolution algorithm is more complex and specified by the ECMAScript standard.

  1.  **Full Path Required**: You must provide the full file path, including the extension (e.g., `import './utils.js'`). You cannot omit the extension like in CommonJS.
  2.  **`package.json` "type" field**: Node.js uses the `"type": "module"` field in `package.json` to treat `.js` files as ES modules. If this is not set, `.js` files are treated as CommonJS. You can use the `.mjs` extension for ESM or `.cjs` for CJS to be explicit.
  3.  **Bare Specifiers**: Importing from `node_modules` (e.g., `import 'express'`) works, but Node's resolver will look at the target package's `package.json` for an `"exports"` field to determine which file to load.

#### **4. What is tree shaking? How do ES modules enable tree shaking in bundlers like Webpack or Rollup?**

**Tree shaking** is a dead-code elimination process used by modern JavaScript bundlers. It analyzes your code and removes any exported functions, variables, or classes that you have not actually used (imported) in your application. The name comes from the analogy of shaking a tree to make the dead leaves fall off.

ES modules are the key enabler for tree shaking because of their **static structure**. The `import` and `export` statements are static; they can only appear at the top level of a module and cannot be changed at runtime. This allows the bundler to build a complete dependency graph of your application _at compile time_. It can see exactly which exports from `utils.js` are being imported into `main.js`. Any exports that are never imported are considered dead code and are safely removed from the final bundle, resulting in a smaller file size and better performance.

---

#### **5. How do you perform dynamic imports? Provide a code example using `import()` and explain its return value.**

You perform dynamic imports using the `import()` function-like expression. Unlike the static `import` statement, `import()` can be called from anywhere in your code (e.g., inside a function, in response to a user event).

The `import('path/to/module.js')` expression:

- Takes the module specifier as an argument.
- Returns a **Promise**.
- This promise resolves with an object that contains all the exports from that module. Named exports are properties on this object, and the default export is on a property named `default`.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// 📁 mathUtils.js
export const add = (a, b) => a + b;
export default (a, b) => a * b; // multiply is the default export

// 📁 main.js
const button = document.getElementById("myButton");

button.addEventListener("click", async () => {
  try {
    // Dynamically import the module when the button is clicked
    const mathModule = await import("./mathUtils.js");

    const sum = mathModule.add(5, 5); // Accessing named export
    const product = mathModule.default(5, 5); // Accessing default export

    console.log("Sum:", sum); // Sum: 10
    console.log("Product:", product); // Product: 25
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to load module:", error);
  }
});
```

#### **6. What is code splitting? How does dynamic `import()` facilitate code splitting in web applications?**

**Code splitting** is the practice of breaking up your application's JavaScript code from a single, large bundle into multiple, smaller chunks. These chunks can then be loaded on demand as the user navigates through the application.

The primary benefit is improved initial load performance. Instead of forcing the user to download the code for your entire application upfront (including code for pages they may never visit), you only serve the essential code needed for the initial page.

Dynamic `import()` is the mechanism that makes code splitting possible. When a bundler like Webpack sees a dynamic `import()` call in your code, it automatically:

1.  Treats the imported module (and its dependencies) as a separate "split point."
2.  Creates a separate JavaScript file (a "chunk") for that module.
3.  When the `import()` function is called in the browser, the bundler's runtime logic handles fetching this chunk over the network and then executes it.

This allows you to load features, routes, or large libraries lazily, only when they are actually needed by the user.

### \#\# Part 2: Medium-Importance Questions 🤔

These questions cover more practical patterns and the nuances of how modules behave in different situations.

---

#### **7. Explain how default exports differ from named exports. When should you use each?**

**Named exports** are for exporting multiple values from a module. They are exported with a specific name and must be imported using that exact same name, enclosed in curly braces `{}`. They are explicit and clear about what is being shared.

- **Use Case**: Use named exports for a module that provides a set of related utility functions (e.g., `add`, `subtract`, `multiply` from a `math.js` file). This allows consumers to import only the specific functions they need.

**Default exports** are for exporting a single, primary value from a module. A module can have at most one default export. When you import a default export, you can assign it any name you want.

- **Use Case**: Use a default export when a module's main purpose is to provide one specific thing, like a React component, a primary class, or a single function.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// 📁 utils.js
// Named exports for multiple, specific utilities
export const PI = 3.14;
export function triple(x) {
  return x * 3;
}

// Default export for the primary function of the module
export default function double(x) {
  return x * 2;
}

// 📁 main.js
import doubleValue, { PI, triple } from "./utils.js"; // Default and named in one line

console.log(doubleValue(5)); // 10 (default export, name is arbitrary)
console.log(triple(5)); // 15 (named export, name must match)
```

#### **8. How do you handle circular dependencies in ES modules vs. CommonJS?**

A circular dependency occurs when Module A depends on Module B, and Module B depends on Module A.

- **CommonJS**: Handles circular dependencies somewhat gracefully, but it can lead to issues. When Module A `require`s Module B, Module B's `module.exports` is immediately returned, even if it's incomplete because it's waiting for Module A. This can result in one of the modules receiving an **empty object `{}`** instead of the intended exports, leading to runtime errors if you try to use a function that hasn't been exported yet.

- **ES Modules**: Handles circular dependencies more elegantly due to its static nature and **live bindings**. Because `import`s are hoisted and exports are just "views" into the original module's variables, an imported value might be temporarily `undefined` if the circular dependency hasn't been evaluated yet. However, as soon as the original module finishes evaluating and assigns a value, that value becomes available in the other module through the live binding. This generally avoids the "empty object" problem of CommonJS, though it can still lead to `undefined` values if you try to use an import before its circular dependency has been initialized.

---

#### **10. How do you lazy-load a React component using dynamic `import()` and `Suspense`? Provide an example.**

Lazy loading in React is a powerful pattern for code splitting on a per-component basis. You use the `React.lazy()` function combined with a dynamic `import()`.

1.  **`React.lazy()`**: You pass it a function that calls a dynamic `import()`. This tells React to load the component's code chunk only when it's first rendered.
2.  **`<Suspense>`**: The lazy-loaded component must be rendered inside a `Suspense` component. `Suspense` allows you to specify a fallback UI (like a loading spinner) that will be shown while the lazy component's code is being fetched and loaded.

**Code Example:**

```jsx
import React, { Suspense, useState } from "react";

// 1. Use React.lazy to import the component.
//    This line doesn't load the component code yet.
const HeavyComponent = React.lazy(() => import("./HeavyComponent"));

function App() {
  const [showComponent, setShowComponent] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setShowComponent(true)}>
        Load Heavy Component
      </button>

      {/* 2. Wrap the lazy component in Suspense */}
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        {showComponent && <HeavyComponent />}
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}

// 📁 HeavyComponent.js (would be in a separate file)
// const HeavyComponent = () => <div>This is a large component!</div>;
// export default HeavyComponent;
```

#### **12. Explain the difference between static and dynamic imports in terms of performance and caching.**

- **Static Imports (`import ... from ...`)**:

  - **Performance**: All statically imported modules are fetched, parsed, and executed upfront when the script is initially loaded. This can lead to a larger initial bundle size and a slower initial page load if you have many modules.
  - **Caching**: All these modules are part of the main bundle. As long as the bundle file itself is cached by the browser (e.g., via cache-control headers), they are loaded from the cache on subsequent visits.

- **Dynamic Imports (`import(...)`)**:

  - **Performance**: This is the key to **code splitting**. The code for a dynamically imported module is not downloaded until the `import()` function is called. This results in a smaller initial bundle and faster initial load times. The trade-off is a small network delay when the feature is first accessed by the user.
  - **Caching**: Each dynamically imported module is loaded as a separate chunk (a separate file). These individual chunk files can be cached by the browser independently. If you only change one lazy-loaded feature, only that small chunk file needs to be re-downloaded by the user, not the entire application bundle.

---

#### **13. What are CommonJS module caching behaviors? How does this differ from ES module caching?**

- **CommonJS Caching**: When you `require()` a module in Node.js, it is loaded, compiled, and executed **only once**. The result (the `module.exports` object) is then stored in a cache (`require.cache`). Any subsequent `require()` call for that same module will return the **cached object instantly** without re-executing the module code. This caching is based on the resolved file path.

- **ES Module Caching**: The behavior is similar but part of the language specification. A module is fetched, parsed, and evaluated **only once**. The JavaScript engine maintains a "module map" of all loaded modules. Subsequent `import`s of the same module simply reference the already loaded module from this map. The key difference is that ES modules have **live bindings**, so while the module code doesn't re-run, changes to an exported variable's value inside the original module are visible to all importers.

These questions cover more advanced, niche, or ecosystem-specific topics. Knowing these can demonstrate a very senior level of expertise.

---

#### **15. Can you mix ES modules and CommonJS in the same project? What are the challenges and solutions?**

Yes, you can, especially in a Node.js environment, but it comes with challenges.

**Challenges**:

1.  **Loading ESM from CJS**: You cannot use a synchronous `require()` to load an ES module because ESM is asynchronous.
2.  **Loading CJS from ESM**: You can `import` a CommonJS module, but it's often treated as a single object with a `default` export, which can be awkward to work with. Named exports are not automatically detected.

**Solutions**:

- **In Node.js**:
  - To load an ESM file from a CJS file, you must use a **dynamic `import()`**.
  - Use the `.mjs` (for ESM) and `.cjs` (for CJS) file extensions to make the module type explicit and avoid ambiguity.
- **In Bundlers (like Webpack)**: Bundlers are designed to handle this interoperability. They can parse both formats and create a consistent dependency graph, largely hiding the complexity from the developer.

---

#### **22. Explain the concept of live bindings in ES modules. How does it work?**

**Live bindings** mean that when you import a variable from a module, you are not getting a copy of its value. Instead, you are getting a live, read-only link to the original variable.

**How it works**:
If the value of that variable changes inside the exporting module (for example, in a `setTimeout`), the change is reflected everywhere that variable is imported. This is unlike CommonJS, which exports a copy of the value at the time `require()` is called.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// 📁 liveCounter.js
export let count = 0;
export function increment() {
  count++;
}

// 📁 main.js
import { count, increment } from "./liveCounter.js";

console.log(count); // 0
increment();
console.log(count); // 1 (The change is reflected here)

// This would be an error, as the binding is read-only.
// count = 5; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

---

#### **24. What are the best practices for organizing large codebases using modules?**

- **Feature-based Organization**: Group files by feature or domain (e.g., a `components/` directory, a `utils/` directory, a `features/user-profile/` directory) rather than by file type. This keeps related logic together.
- **Use an `index.js` Barrel File**: Use an `index.js` file in a directory to re-export the public API of that directory. This allows for cleaner import paths, like `import { UserCard } from './components'` instead of `import { UserCard } from './components/UserCard/UserCard.js'`.
- **Prefer Default Exports for the Main Thing**: If a module has a primary purpose (like a React component), use a default export for it and named exports for any secondary helpers.
- **Keep Modules Focused**: Modules should be small and adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle. They should do one thing and do it well.
- **Minimize Side Effects**: A module should ideally only export functionality. Code that runs automatically upon import (a side effect) can be hard to reason about and can break tree shaking.

---

#### **25. How do you detect unused modules in a codebase and remove them safely?**

- **Linters**: Tools like ESLint with plugins (`eslint-plugin-import`) can often detect modules that are imported but never used within a file.
- **Bundler Analysis**: Tools like `webpack-bundle-analyzer` can generate a visual treemap of your final bundle. This can help you spot large dependencies or chunks that you didn't expect, which might point to unused code.
- **Code Coverage Tools**: Tools like Jest's coverage reporter can show you which files and lines of code are not being executed by your tests. Files with 0% coverage are strong candidates for being unused.
- **Manual and Automated Refactoring**: For safe removal, start by searching the codebase for any usages of the module's exports. If none are found, you can try deleting it and running your entire test suite to ensure nothing breaks. This process can be aided by automated refactoring tools in modern IDEs.
