# Topic - **Higher-Order Functions**
  - Map, filter, reduce
  - Write utility functions (e.g., custom `map`, `filter`)

### High Importance

#### 1\. What is a higher-order function in JavaScript? Give examples.

A **higher-order function** is a function that does at least one of the following:

1.  Takes one or more functions as arguments.
2.  Returns a function as its result.

This is possible because JavaScript treats functions as **first-class citizens**, meaning they can be passed around and used just like any other value (like a number or a string).

**Common built-in examples** include:

- `Array.prototype.map()`
- `Array.prototype.filter()`
- `Array.prototype.reduce()`
- `setTimeout()`

Here’s a simple custom example of a function that takes another function as an argument:

```javascript
// `withLogging` is a higher-order function because it takes a function `fn` as an argument.
function withLogging(fn) {
  return function (...args) {
    console.log(`Calling function: ${fn.name}`);
    return fn(...args);
  };
}

function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// We "wrap" our `add` function to create a new one with logging.
const addWithLogging = withLogging(add);
addWithLogging(5, 3); // Logs "Calling function: add" and returns 8.
```

---

#### 2\. Explain the differences between `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`. When would you use each?

`map`, `filter`, and `reduce` are all higher-order functions that iterate over an array without modifying the original. They are the core of immutable data transformations.

- **`map`**: **Transforms** each element in an array. It creates a **new array** of the **exact same length** as the original, where each element is the result of calling the callback function on the corresponding original element.

  - **Use when**: You want to convert each item in an array into something else (e.g., get an array of names from an array of user objects, or double every number in an array).

  <!-- end list -->

  ```javascript
  const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
  const doubled = numbers.map((num) => num * 2); // [2, 4, 6]
  ```

- **`filter`**: **Selects** elements from an array. It creates a **new array** containing only the elements that pass a test (i.e., for which the callback function returns `true`). The new array's length can be the same as or smaller than the original.

  - **Use when**: You want to create a subset of an array based on some condition (e.g., get all active users, or find all numbers greater than 10).

  <!-- end list -->

  ```javascript
  const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  const evens = numbers.filter((num) => num % 2 === 0); // [2, 4]
  ```

- **`reduce`**: **Aggregates** all elements in an array into a **single value**. This value can be anything: a number, a string, an object, or even another array. It iterates through the array, maintaining an "accumulator" that it builds upon with each element.

  - **Use when**: You want to "boil down" an array to a single result (e.g., calculate the sum of all numbers, flatten an array of arrays, or group an array of objects by a property).

  <!-- end list -->

  ```javascript
  const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
  const sum = numbers.reduce((total, num) => total + num, 0); // 15
  ```

---

#### 3\. How do you implement a custom version of `Array.prototype.map`? Provide code.

Absolutely. A custom `map` function needs to iterate over the array, call the provided callback for each element, and build a new array with the results.

```javascript
Array.prototype.customMap = function (callback) {
  // `this` refers to the array the function is called on.
  if (typeof callback !== "function") {
    throw new TypeError(callback + " is not a function");
  }

  const newArray = []; // 1. Create a new array to store results.

  // 2. Loop through the original array.
  for (let i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
    // 3. For each element, call the callback with the value, index, and original array.
    const result = callback(this[i], i, this);

    // 4. Push the result of the callback into the new array.
    newArray.push(result);
  }

  // 5. Return the newly created array.
  return newArray;
};

// --- Usage ---
const numbers = [1, 4, 9];
const roots = numbers.customMap((num) => Math.sqrt(num));
console.log(roots); // [1, 2, 3]
```

---

#### 4\. How do you implement a custom version of `Array.prototype.filter`? Provide code.

A custom `filter` is very similar to `map`, but instead of pushing the _result_ of the callback, it pushes the _original element_ only if the callback returns a truthy value.

```javascript
Array.prototype.customFilter = function (callback) {
  if (typeof callback !== "function") {
    throw new TypeError(callback + " is not a function");
  }

  const newArray = []; // 1. Create a new array.

  for (let i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
    // 2. For each element, call the callback.
    const passesTest = callback(this[i], i, this);

    // 3. If the callback returns a truthy value...
    if (passesTest) {
      // 4. ...push the ORIGINAL element into the new array.
      newArray.push(this[i]);
    }
  }

  // 5. Return the new array.
  return newArray;
};

// --- Usage ---
const words = ["spray", "limit", "elite", "exuberant"];
const longWords = words.customFilter((word) => word.length > 6);
console.log(longWords); // ["exuberant"]
```

---

#### 5\. How do you implement a custom version of `Array.prototype.reduce`? Provide code.

Implementing `reduce` is the most complex of the three. It needs to handle the accumulator and the optional initial value.

```javascript
Array.prototype.customReduce = function (callback, initialValue) {
  if (typeof callback !== "function") {
    throw new TypeError(callback + " is not a function");
  }

  const array = this;
  let accumulator = initialValue;
  let startIndex = 0;

  // 1. If no initial value is provided...
  if (initialValue === undefined) {
    // ...and the array is empty, throw an error.
    if (array.length === 0) {
      throw new TypeError("Reduce of empty array with no initial value");
    }
    // ...use the first element as the accumulator and start from the second.
    accumulator = array[0];
    startIndex = 1;
  }

  // 2. Loop through the array from the determined start index.
  for (let i = startIndex; i < array.length; i++) {
    // 3. Update the accumulator by calling the callback.
    accumulator = callback(accumulator, array[i], i, array);
  }

  // 4. Return the final accumulated value.
  return accumulator;
};

// --- Usage ---
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
const sum = numbers.customReduce((acc, current) => acc + current, 0);
console.log(sum); // 10
```

---

#### 6\. What are the callback parameters for `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`? Explain each parameter’s role.

The callback signatures are very similar, with `reduce` having one extra parameter at the beginning.

For **`map` and `filter`**: `callback(currentValue, index, array)`

- `currentValue`: The current element being processed in the array.
- `index` (Optional): The index of the `currentValue`.
- `array` (Optional): The array `map` or `filter` was called upon.

For **`reduce`**: `callback(accumulator, currentValue, index, array)`

- `accumulator`: The value resulting from the previous callback invocation. On the first call, it's the `initialValue` if provided; otherwise, it's the first element of the array.
- `currentValue`: The current element being processed.
- `index` (Optional): The index of the `currentValue`.
- `array` (Optional): The array `reduce` was called upon.

The `index` and `array` parameters are less commonly used but are useful in more complex scenarios where you need context about the element's position.

---

#### 7\. Why does `reduce` not modify the original array, and how can it be used to calculate sums, flatten arrays, or build objects?

`reduce` doesn't modify the original array because its entire purpose is to produce a **new, single value**—the accumulator. The callback function's job is to define how to create the _next state_ of the accumulator based on the current one and the current array element. The original array is only ever read from. This adherence to immutability makes the code more predictable.

Here’s how it can be used for various tasks:

- **Calculate a sum** (number):

  ```javascript
  const numbers = [10, 20, 30];
  const total = numbers.reduce((sum, num) => sum + num, 0); // 60
  ```

- **Flatten an array of arrays** (array):

  ```javascript
  const nested = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5]];
  const flat = nested.reduce((acc, subArray) => acc.concat(subArray), []); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  ```

- **Build an object** (grouping items):

  ```javascript
  const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "apple", "orange", "banana", "apple"];
  const fruitCount = fruits.reduce((tally, fruit) => {
    tally[fruit] = (tally[fruit] || 0) + 1;
    return tally;
  }, {}); // { apple: 3, banana: 2, orange: 1 }
  ```

---

#### 8\. Demonstrate how chaining `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` can solve a complex data-transformation problem in a single expression.

Certainly. Chaining these functions creates a clean, readable data processing pipeline.

**Problem**: Given a list of products, calculate the total cost of all electronics that are in stock and have a price over $500.

```javascript
const products = [
  { name: "Laptop", category: "Electronics", price: 1200, inStock: true },
  { name: "Shirt", category: "Apparel", price: 25, inStock: true },
  { name: "Headphones", category: "Electronics", price: 300, inStock: false },
  { name: "Keyboard", category: "Electronics", price: 75, inStock: true },
  { name: "Monitor", category: "Electronics", price: 600, inStock: true },
];

const totalCost = products
  // 1. Find only the electronics that are in stock.
  .filter((product) => product.category === "Electronics" && product.inStock)

  // 2. From those, select only the ones costing more than $500.
  .filter((product) => product.price > 500)

  // 3. Get an array of just their prices.
  .map((product) => product.price)

  // 4. Sum up the prices.
  .reduce((total, price) => total + price, 0);

console.log(totalCost); // 1800 (from Laptop $1200 + Monitor $600)
```

This is much more declarative and easier to follow than a traditional `for` loop with multiple `if` statements.

---

Of course. Let's move on to the next set of questions.

---

### Medium Importance

#### 9\. What is the difference between `forEach` and `map`? Why doesn’t `forEach` return a new array?

The main difference lies in their **return value** and their **intended purpose**.

- **`map`** is for **data transformation**. Its purpose is to take an array, transform each element, and **return a new array** of the same length containing the transformed elements.
- **`forEach`** is for **executing side effects**. Its purpose is to execute a function for each element in the array, but it **returns `undefined`**. It doesn't create a new array.

You use **`map`** when you need a new array with modified data. You use **`forEach`** when you just want to _do_ something with each element, like logging it to the console, saving it to a database, or updating the DOM.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];

// USE MAP: for transformation
const squaredNumbers = numbers.map((n) => n * 2);
console.log(squaredNumbers); // [2, 4, 6]

// USE FOREACH: for side effects
let sum = 0;
numbers.forEach((n) => {
  sum += n; // This is a side effect: modifying the `sum` variable
});
console.log(sum); // 6
```

---

#### 10\. How would you use `reduce` to implement `map` or `filter`?

This is a great way to demonstrate a deep understanding of `reduce`. Since `reduce` is the most versatile of the array methods, it can be used to replicate the behavior of the others.

**Implementing `map` using `reduce`:**
The goal is to build a new array. The accumulator (`acc`) will be this new array. For each element, we'll run the callback on it and push the result into the accumulator.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];

const mappedWithReduce = numbers.reduce((acc, current) => {
  // Push the transformed element into the accumulator array
  acc.push(current * 2);
  return acc;
}, []); // Start with an empty array as the initial value

console.log(mappedWithReduce); // [2, 4, 6]
```

**Implementing `filter` using `reduce`:**
Again, the accumulator is the new array we're building. We'll run the callback on each element, and if it returns `true`, we'll push the _original element_ into the accumulator.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const filteredWithReduce = numbers.reduce((acc, current) => {
  // If the element passes the test...
  if (current % 2 === 0) {
    // ...push the original element into the accumulator array
    acc.push(current);
  }
  return acc;
}, []); // Start with an empty array

console.log(filteredWithReduce); // [2, 4]
```

---

#### 11\. Explain the concept of function composition. How can you compose multiple functions to create a pipeline?

**Function composition** is the process of combining two or more functions to produce a new function. The output of one function becomes the input of the next, creating a sequence or a "pipeline" for data. It's a core concept in functional programming.

You can create a simple `compose` or `pipe` utility to handle this. `compose` typically works from right to left, while `pipe` works from left to right.

Here's an example with a `pipe` function:

```javascript
// Simple utility functions
const double = (x) => x * 2;
const addTen = (x) => x + 10;
const toCurrency = (x) => `$${x.toFixed(2)}`;

// `pipe` is a higher-order function that takes functions and returns a new function.
const pipe =
  (...fns) =>
  (initialValue) =>
    fns.reduce((acc, fn) => fn(acc), initialValue);

// Create a new function by composing the simple ones.
const calculatePrice = pipe(
  double, // 2. The result (20) is passed here. Output: 40
  addTen, // 3. The result (40) is passed here. Output: 50
  toCurrency // 4. The result (50) is passed here. Output: "$50.00"
);

// Run a value through the pipeline.
const finalPrice = calculatePrice(20); // 1. The initial value is 20.
console.log(finalPrice); // "$50.00"
```

---

#### 12\. What is immutability and how do `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` help maintain it?

**Immutability** is a principle where data (like an object or array) cannot be changed after it's created. Instead of modifying the original data structure, you create a new one with the updated values.

`map`, `filter`, and `reduce` are essential tools for maintaining immutability because they are designed **not to modify the original array**.

- `map` returns a **new** array.
- `filter` returns a **new** array.
- `reduce` returns a **new** value (which could be an array or object).

By using these methods, you avoid **side effects** (unintended modifications to data). This makes your code more predictable, easier to debug, and safer to use in complex applications, especially those with a shared state like in React.

---

#### 13\. Describe potential performance issues when chaining many higher-order functions on large arrays. How can you mitigate them?

While chaining is very readable, it can have performance implications on very large datasets (e.g., millions of elements).

**The Issue**: Each method in the chain (`.filter().map()`) creates and iterates over a **new intermediate array**.

1.  `filter` iterates through the entire original array to create `newArray1`.
2.  `map` then iterates through the entire `newArray1` to create `newArray2`.

This creation of intermediate arrays can consume significant memory and CPU time.

**Mitigation Strategies**:

1.  **Use `reduce`**: You can combine the logic of `filter` and `map` into a single `reduce` operation. This processes the array in a single pass, avoiding any intermediate arrays.
2.  **Use a `for` loop**: For performance-critical code, a traditional `for` or `for...of` loop is often the fastest approach, as it has the least overhead.
3.  **Lazy Evaluation**: Use a library like **Lodash**. Its `_.chain()` method performs "lazy evaluation," where it doesn't create intermediate arrays. Instead, it fuses the operations and iterates only once when the final value is requested (e.g., with `.value()`).

---

#### 14\. What happens if you modify the array inside a `map` or `filter` callback? Is this recommended?

Modifying the array while iterating over it with these methods is **highly discouraged**. It's an anti-pattern that leads to unpredictable and buggy code.

The behavior can be strange because:

- The `length` of the array is cached before the loop begins.
- The element passed to the callback is determined by its index at that moment.

If you add elements, they might or might not be visited. If you remove elements (e.g., with `splice`), you can end up skipping over the next element because the indices have shifted. This violates the principle of immutability and makes the function's outcome unreliable.

---

#### 15\. How do you handle asynchronous operations inside `map`, `filter`, or `reduce`? What are the pitfalls?

This is a common source of confusion. `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` are **synchronous**. They will **not** wait for promises inside their callbacks to resolve.

**The Pitfall with `map`**: If you use an `async` callback with `map`, you won't get an array of resolved values. You'll get an **array of pending promises**.

```javascript
const userIds = [1, 2, 3];

async function fetchUser(id) {
  // some async fetch logic...
  return { id, name: `User ${id}` };
}

const userPromises = userIds.map((id) => fetchUser(id));
// userPromises is now [Promise<pending>, Promise<pending>, Promise<pending>]

// THE SOLUTION: Use Promise.all() to wait for all of them.
const users = await Promise.all(userPromises);
// users is now [{id:1, name:'User 1'}, ...]
```

**The Pitfall with `filter`**: You can't directly `filter` with an async callback because it will always return a promise (which is truthy), so nothing will be filtered out. The solution is more complex, often involving a `map` with `Promise.all` first, followed by a synchronous `filter`.

---

#### 16\. Can you use `await` with `reduce`? Demonstrate the pattern for sequential async operations.

Yes, you can, and it's the standard pattern for running a series of promises **sequentially** (one after the other), as opposed to in parallel with `Promise.all`.

This is useful when the result of one async operation is needed for the next, or if you want to avoid overwhelming an API with too many concurrent requests.

The key is to make the accumulator a promise. Each step in the `reduce` chain waits for the previous step's promise to resolve before continuing.

```javascript
const urls = ["/api/data/1", "/api/data/2", "/api/data/3"];

async function fetchData(url) {
  console.log(`Fetching ${url}...`);
  // Simulate a network request
  return new Promise((resolve) =>
    setTimeout(() => resolve(`Data from ${url}`), 500)
  );
}

// The reducer runs the promises one by one.
const sequentialFetch = async () => {
  await urls.reduce(async (promise, url) => {
    // 1. Wait for the previous promise in the chain to finish.
    await promise;
    // 2. Now, run the current async operation.
    return fetchData(url);
  }, Promise.resolve()); // 3. Start the chain with an already resolved promise.
};

sequentialFetch();
// Logs will appear sequentially, 500ms apart.
```

---

Alright, let's tackle the final set of questions.

---

### Low Importance

#### 17\. How do you use `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` with typed arrays or custom iterable objects?

They work directly on **TypedArrays** (like `Uint8Array`) just like regular arrays.

For **custom iterable objects** (like a `Map`, `Set`, or a custom object with a `Symbol.iterator`), you must first convert the iterable into a true array before you can use these methods. The easiest ways are with `Array.from()` or the spread syntax `[...]`.

```javascript
const mySet = new Set([1, 2, 3, 3, 4]);

// Convert the set to an array first, then map over it.
const doubled = Array.from(mySet).map((num) => num * 2); // [2, 4, 6, 8]
```

---

#### 18\. How can you implement a lazy evaluation of chained higher-order functions to improve performance?

Native array methods in JavaScript are **eager**, meaning they create intermediate arrays at each step. **Lazy evaluation** defers the execution of the chain until the final value is requested and processes the data in a single pass.

You wouldn't implement this from scratch in a typical project. Instead, you would use a library like **Lodash** or **RxJS**. With Lodash, you can wrap an array in `_.chain()` to enable lazy evaluation. The operations are only executed when you call `.value()`.

```javascript
// This would be a Lodash example, not native JS
// const result = _.chain(largeArray)
//   .filter(user => user.active)
//   .map(user => user.name)
//   .take(5) // only takes the first 5 results
//   .value();
// The array is only iterated once until 5 active users are found.
```

This is much more efficient for very large datasets, especially when you only need a subset of the results.

---

#### 19\. Write a utility function `pipe` that takes functions as arguments and returns a new function applying them left-to-right.

Certainly. The `pipe` function can be elegantly implemented using `reduce`.

```javascript
/**
 * Creates a left-to-right pipeline of functions.
 * @param {...Function} fns The functions to pipe.
 * @returns {Function} A new function that runs a value through the pipeline.
 */
const pipe =
  (...fns) =>
  (initialValue) =>
    fns.reduce((value, fn) => fn(value), initialValue);

// --- Usage ---
const getName = (person) => person.name;
const uppercase = (str) => str.toUpperCase();
const exclaim = (str) => `${str}!`;

const shoutName = pipe(getName, uppercase, exclaim);
console.log(shoutName({ name: "Gandalf" })); // "GANDALF!"
```

---

#### 20\. How would you implement a `zip` function using `map` or `reduce`?

A `zip` function takes two arrays and merges them into an array of pairs. Using `map` is the most straightforward approach. You map over the first array and use its index to pick out the corresponding element from the second array.

```javascript
function zip(arr1, arr2) {
  // We map over the shorter of the two arrays to avoid out-of-bounds access.
  const length = Math.min(arr1.length, arr2.length);

  return Array.from({ length }).map((_, index) => {
    return [arr1[index], arr2[index]];
  });
}

const letters = ["a", "b", "c"];
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]; // Extra element will be ignored
console.log(zip(letters, numbers)); // [['a', 1], ['b', 2], ['c', 3]]
```

---

#### 21\. Explain the difference between `Array.from` and using `map` on an array-like object.

While both can achieve a similar result, `Array.from` is often more direct and can be more performant.

`Array.from()` has an optional second argument which is a **mapping function**. This allows it to convert an array-like object or iterable into a new array _and_ map over it in a **single pass**.

Using `.map()` requires two steps: first, you convert the object to an array, and _then_ you iterate over that new array to map it.

```javascript
// Example: Get all the tag names from a NodeList (which is array-like)
const elements = document.querySelectorAll("div");

// Two steps: convert, then map
const tagNamesTwoSteps = [...elements].map((el) => el.tagName);

// One step with Array.from
const tagNamesOneStep = Array.from(elements, (el) => el.tagName);
```

---

#### 22\. How do you polyfill `filter` or `map` without modifying `Array.prototype`?

You would write a standalone utility function that takes the array as its first argument instead of using `this`. This is a safer pattern in shared environments where modifying built-in prototypes (monkey-patching) is discouraged.

```javascript
function mapArray(array, callback) {
  if (!Array.isArray(array) || typeof callback !== "function") {
    // Basic error handling
    return [];
  }

  const newArray = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    newArray.push(callback(array[i], i, array));
  }
  return newArray;
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const doubled = mapArray(numbers, (num) => num * 2);
console.log(doubled); // [2, 4, 6]
```

---

#### 23\. What is the significance of the `initialValue` in `reduce`? What happens when it’s omitted?

The `initialValue` is extremely significant.

- **When it's provided**: `reduce` uses it as the starting value for the accumulator, and it begins iterating from the very first element (index 0) of the array.
- **When it's omitted**:
  1.  `reduce` takes the **first element** of the array as the starting accumulator value.
  2.  It begins iterating from the **second element** (index 1).
  3.  If the array is **empty**, it will throw a `TypeError`. This is a very common source of bugs.

It's best practice to **always provide an `initialValue`** to make your `reduce` function predictable and prevent errors with empty arrays.

---

#### 24\. How can you detect and handle errors thrown inside higher-order function callbacks?

Errors thrown inside a callback function will propagate up just like any other error. You can handle them by wrapping the entire higher-order function call in a `try...catch` block.

```javascript
const data = [1, 2, "oops", 4];

try {
  const processed = data.map((item) => {
    if (typeof item !== "number") {
      throw new Error(`Invalid data type: ${typeof item}`);
    }
    return item * 2;
  });
  console.log(processed);
} catch (error) {
  console.error("An error occurred during processing:", error.message);
  // Output: An error occurred during processing: Invalid data type: string
}
```

---

#### 25\. Describe how garbage collection works when using closures in callbacks passed to higher-order functions.

The callback function you pass to a higher-order function is a **closure**—it maintains a reference to its surrounding (lexical) environment.

This means that any variables from the parent scope that the callback uses cannot be garbage collected as long as the callback itself is alive. However, once the higher-order function (like `map`) completes its execution, and there are no other references to the callback function, the callback and its closed-over environment become eligible for garbage collection. The JavaScript engine is very good at cleaning this up automatically.

---

#### 26\. Can you implement a `flatMap` function using `map` and `reduce`?

Yes. A `flatMap` is essentially a `map` followed by a `flat` operation of depth 1. You can achieve this by combining `map` and `reduce`.

```javascript
function flatMap(array, callback) {
  return array.reduce((acc, item) => {
    // Call the callback on the item, which might return an array
    const mappedItem = callback(item);
    // Concatenate the result into our accumulator
    return acc.concat(mappedItem);
  }, []);
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
// For each number, return an array of the number and its double
const result = flatMap(numbers, (x) => [x, x * 2]);
console.log(result); // [1, 2, 2, 4, 3, 6]
```

Of course, in modern JavaScript, you would just use the built-in `arr.flatMap(callback)`.

---

#### 27\. How do you test higher-order functions for correctness and performance?

My approach would be:

1.  **Correctness (Unit Tests)**: Using a framework like Jest, I'd write tests covering:

    - **Typical cases**: A standard array with multiple elements.
    - **Edge cases**: An empty array `[]`, an array with a single element, and arrays containing `null`, `undefined`, or mixed data types.
    - **Callback arguments**: Assert that the callback receives the correct `(value, index, array)` arguments.

2.  **Performance (Benchmarking)**:

    - For simple checks, I'd use `console.time('testName')` and `console.timeEnd('testName')`.
    - For more robust benchmarking, I'd use a library like `benchmark.js`.
    - I would run tests against very large arrays to compare the performance of different implementations (e.g., chained HOFs vs. `reduce` vs. a `for` loop).

#### 28\. Explain the relationship between higher-order functions and the concept of first-class functions in JavaScript.

They are directly related. The existence of higher-order functions is a **direct consequence** of JavaScript having **first-class functions**.

"First-class functions" means that functions are treated like any other value in the language. You can:

- Assign them to variables.
- Store them in arrays or objects.
- **Pass them as arguments to other functions.**
- **Return them from other functions.**

The last two points are the definition of a higher-order function. So, you can't have higher-order functions without first-class functions; it's the enabling feature.

#### 29\. What are tail-recursive implementations of `reduce`, and when would you use them?

A tail-recursive implementation is a style of writing a recursive function where the recursive call is the **very last thing** the function does. In environments that support Tail Call Optimization (TCO), this allows the engine to reuse the same stack frame, preventing stack overflow errors with deep recursion.

You could theoretically write `reduce` this way, but it's not a practical pattern in JavaScript because **most major JavaScript engines do not implement TCO**. Therefore, a standard iterative `for` loop (like in the polyfill I showed earlier) is always preferred for `reduce` as it's safer and more performant.

#### 30\. How would you implement a `groupBy` function using `reduce`?

This is an excellent and very common use case for `reduce`: transforming a flat array into an object of grouped arrays.

```javascript
/**
 * Groups elements of an array by a key generated from a callback.
 * @param {Array} array The array to process.
 * @param {Function} callback The function to generate the key.
 * @returns {Object} An object with keys and arrays of grouped items.
 */
function groupBy(array, callback) {
  return array.reduce((groups, item) => {
    // 1. Get the key for the current item (e.g., 'even' or 'odd').
    const key = callback(item);

    // 2. If this key doesn't exist in our groups object yet, create it.
    if (!groups[key]) {
      groups[key] = [];
    }

    // 3. Push the current item into the correct group.
    groups[key].push(item);

    // 4. Return the updated groups object for the next iteration.
    return groups;
  }, {}); // Start with an empty object.
}

// --- Usage ---
const numbers = [1.1, 1.2, 2.3, 3.4, 3.5];
const groupedByInteger = groupBy(numbers, Math.floor);

console.log(groupedByInteger);
// Output: { '1': [1.1, 1.2], '2': [2.3], '3': [3.4, 3.5] }
```
