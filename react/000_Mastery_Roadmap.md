# Complete React Mastery Roadmap (6–8 Weeks)

**Goal:** Achieve deep expertise in React and its modern ecosystem tools, covering core and advanced concepts, state management, data fetching, styling, testing, and performance. Backend and frameworks like Next.js will be addressed separately.

---

## Phase 1: Core React Fundamentals (Weeks 1–2)

1. **Component Architecture**

   - Functional vs. class components: lifecycle methods vs. hooks
   - Composition patterns: children props, slots, compound components

2. **JSX Deep Dive**

   - Babel transform to `React.createElement`
   - Fragments (`<>…</>`) and conditional rendering
   - Keys, event binding, and JSX pitfalls

3. **State & Effects**

   - `useState` with lazy init and updater function
   - `useReducer` for complex logic
   - `useEffect` cleanup, dependency arrays, custom hooks
   - `useLayoutEffect` vs. `useEffect`

4. **Context API**
   - Create contexts, providers, and consumers
   - Avoid prop drilling, memoize context value
   - Build theme or auth context examples

---

## Phase 2: Advanced Component Patterns (Weeks 3–4)

1. **Performance Optimization**

   - Virtual DOM, reconciliation, and React Fiber
   - Memoization: `React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`

2. **Code Splitting**

   - `React.lazy` and `Suspense` for components
   - Dynamic `import()` for route-level splitting

3. **Advanced Design Patterns**

   - Higher-Order Components (HOCs): implementation and caveats
   - Render Props: flexibility vs. readability
   - Compound Components: API design for parent-child communication
   - Error Boundaries: class-based error handling and fallbacks

4. **React Profiler**
   - DevTools Profiler for render timings and wasted renders
   - `<Profiler>` API for custom metrics

---

## Phase 3: State Management & Data Fetching (Weeks 5–6)

1. **Redux Toolkit**

   - `createSlice`, `configureStore`, and `createAsyncThunk`
   - RTK Query for server state and caching

2. **Alternative State Libraries**

   - **Zustand**: simple hook-based store
   - **Recoil**: atoms and selectors for granular state
   - **MobX**: observable state, reactions, and actions

3. **Data Fetching Libraries**
   - **React Query/TanStack Query**: caching, background refetch, pagination
   - **Axios** vs. native `fetch` with hooks
   - Handling WebSockets and real-time events in React

---

## Phase 4: Styling & UI Frameworks (Week 7)

1. **CSS-in-JS**

   - **styled-components**: theming, SSR support
   - **Emotion**: performant styling, CSS prop

2. **Utility-First Frameworks**

   - **Tailwind CSS**: JIT compiler, responsive utilities
   - Integration with React components

3. **Component Libraries & Design Systems**
   - Using **Chakra UI**, **Material-UI**, or **Ant Design**
   - Building a custom library with **Storybook** for documentation

---

## Phase 5: Testing & Quality Assurance (Week 8)

1. **Unit & Integration Testing**

   - **Jest**: mocking, snapshot tests
   - **React Testing Library**: DOM queries, user event simulations

2. **End-to-End Testing**

   - **Cypress** or **Playwright**: user flows, network stubbing, visual regression

3. **Type Safety**
   - **TypeScript**: typed props, generic hooks, context typing
   - **PropTypes** for runtime checks (legacy support)

---

## Phase 6: Performance & Tooling (Ongoing)

1. **Profiling & Metrics**

   - React Profiler and **Lighthouse** audits
   - Bundle analysis with **Webpack Bundle Analyzer**

2. **Build Optimizations**

   - Tree shaking, dead code elimination
   - Lazy loading assets and images

3. **Developer Experience**
   - ESLint and Prettier with React plugins
   - Husky pre-commit hooks and lint-staged

---

**Capstone React Projects**

- **Interactive Dashboard** using Redux Toolkit Query and charting libraries
- **Form Wizard** with React Hook Form and custom validation
- **Chat Interface** using WebSockets and context for real-time state
- **Design System** with Storybook and styled-components

---

By following this structured React-only roadmap—mastering core concepts, advanced patterns, modern state/data tools, styling, and testing—you’ll be prepared for production-grade React development and technical interviews at top companies.
